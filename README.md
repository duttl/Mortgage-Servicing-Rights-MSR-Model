# Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) Model

The project has been created with a goal of being a full scale software, which can be used as a SaaS tool.

## Overview:

- In Mortgage world, every loan has an MSR value. This value is used by the organizations/ investors who buy and sell loans in the Secondary Market.
- The MSR model is used to calculate the present day value of a given loan.
- The model has the capability to take the characteristincs of a loan, like, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit Score, State, Interest Rate, Remaining Balance and calculate the MSR value of the loan in ~ 0.07 seconds. 
- The back end is built in Python. 
- Data Pipelines are created to laod the data from SQL or any cloud server or manually from local drive.


### Final Result:

- The project is still under development. Working on building the front end and deploying the model on cloud.
- Once deployed, anyone can check what the MSR value of their loan is.
- If you're someone who has a mortgage, you can input the characteristincs of your loan like, loan amount, interest rate, loan term can calcute how much your monthly payment would be. 
- It also provides the capability to check how much money you can save on interest payments, how early you can pay your loan off, by making an additional extra payment every month.
